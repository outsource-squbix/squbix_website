    <h3 style={{color:'white'}}>Decentralized Exchange</h3>
       <p style={{color:'white'}}>
       A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a (P2P) peer-to-peer marketplace that connects cryptocurrency buyers and sellers. Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized platforms are non-custodial, meaning a user remains in control of their private keys when performing a transaction on a DEX platform. Without a central authority, DEXs self-execute itself under set conditions and record each transaction to the blockchain. 
As users do not need to transfer their assets to the exchange, decentralized exchanges reduce the risk of hacking. Decentralized exchanges can also prevent price manipulation or faked trading and are more anonymous than exchanges which implement know your customer (KYC) requirements.
